# Step 6 - Enhance It
Great stuff, we are up and running. Now why not try to make some changes to the microservice, test them locally, then push your update application to Predix. <br/><br/>

Here are a few ideas of things you might want to try to take your skills to the next level.<br/><br/>

### Predix
- Add another instance to your application
- View recent application logs
- Push on the other groups microservice example (Eg pick the booking-microservice if you were working on a machine one)

### Javascript
- Use console.log statements to gain a better understanding of the code
- Try to add your own /api/v1/helloworld endpoint
- Add input validation to existing endpoints
- Modify the get bookings endpoint to return machine name instead of machine id
