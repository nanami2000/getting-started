# Welcome

## Before the Day

In order to maximise the time available to you in the session for completing the lab activities, we recommend that you follow the instructions document inside the `prework` folder, to get your environment up and running in advance

## On the Day

On the day, make use of the `session activity` folder to work through the lab steps. Don't forget to ask those around you or the conference team if you get stuck or don't understand what's going on.
